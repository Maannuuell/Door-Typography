Blender Door Typography


This .blender contains the the model text, camera and lights all set up. You can just render it right away and do what you like with it. 

You can add colour in any Graphics Program you like. You can edit in blender and add any features you would like. 


This is inspired by a Cinema 4D. Here is a link to my tutorial on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6i42aHJ3p8
